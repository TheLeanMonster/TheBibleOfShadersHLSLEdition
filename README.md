# TheBibleOfShadersHLSLEdition
This repository will contain a collection of royalty free simple HLSL shaders made in Terraria to help game developers and terraria modders.

To convert from HLSL just use "vec" instead of "float" (this applies only for things like float2 and above,you can still use float if it has only 1 parameter if it has more than 1 parameter you have to use "vec".
